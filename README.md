UNIX IN A BROWSER
=================

we're dreaming to create a virtual file system whenever you open a unjs based
site in your browser.

unix history will repeat in a browser via this project. js instead of c this
time.

we have to reimplement POSIX file descriptors logic first. then a shell (jssh)
will follow. then the commands ls, cat, more, head, tail, grep, find, etc., and
even X.

at the end maybe we can achieve to run gnu/linux ports on our browser.
