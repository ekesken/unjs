UNIX IN A BROWSER
=================

we're dreaming to create a virtual file system whenever you open a unjs based
site in your browser.

unix history will repeat in a browser via this project. js instead of c this
time.

we have to reimplement POSIX file descriptors logic first. then a shell (jssh)
will follow. then the commands ls, cat, more, head, tail, grep, find, etc., and
even X.

at the end maybe we can achieve to run gnu/linux ports on our browser.

WHAT IS NOT?
============

this is not an emulator project!
--------------------------------

if that's what you're looking for see:

* http://bellard.org/jslinux/ (unfortunately source code is not available)

we do not try to run unix on a browser, we try to create a new js framework
with "everything is file" philosophy (plan9 may be a better inspiration source
then unix).
